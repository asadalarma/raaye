                            Raaye values our members’ opinions, and to show our appreciation, Raaye offers incentives
                            in the form of credits called “Points,” which are credited to your account maintained by
                            Raaye. Points are redeemable for cash, prizes or entries into sweepstakes as specified and
                            subject to the terms below.</p>

                            Points will be credited to your account only through your participation in activities
                            authorized by Raaye, which include, but are not limited to, registration as a panelist,
                            completion of demographic profiles and completion of qualitative or quantitative marketing
                            research activities performed by Raaye, and only in accordance with the specific incentive
                            offer disclosed for each activity. Specifically, you may earn points as follows:</p>
                        <ul style="font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;; line-height: 20.8px;">
                            <li>Survey Completion: Earn Points for each survey you qualify for and complete. Points
                                awarded vary by survey.
                            </li>
                            <li>Personal Interest Survey (Profile) Completion: Panelists can earn additional Points by
                                completing the member profiles. Each completed profile is worth an additional 100
                                Points.
                            </li>

                        <p style="font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;; line-height: 20.8px;">
                            In addition, you will earn entries to our daily Raaye Millionaire sweepstakes (see official
                            rules below), when you initially join the community as well as when you answer our surveys
                            with 1 lucky winner a day winning 1,000,000 points, worth $300 in points to spend.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;; line-height: 20.8px;">
                            The timing of credits for points or sweepstakes entries depends on the Survey. For some
                            Surveys, credits are applied very quickly or within a few days; for others, the credits are
                            applied after the Survey has closed.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;; line-height: 20.8px;">
                            Raaye will maintain a record of the Points credited to and debited from your account and
                            allow you to check the status of your account online by logging in and checking the "Your
                            Points" tab. Although Raaye makes every effort to ensure that accounts are credited
                            correctly, it is your responsibility to verify that your Points have been credited properly.
                            If you feel the incentive amounts credited to your account are incorrect, you must contact
                            Raaye by email within 60 days following our alleged error and explain in full the basis of
                            your dispute, attaching any relevant information which offers evidence of the discrepancy.
                            Upon receipt of your notice, we will investigate your claim and notify you of our decision
                            to adjust or maintain the amount of Points credited to your account, as we deem appropriate,
                            within thirty (30) days. If we need additional time to decide your claim, we will notify you
                            and will endeavor to render a decision as soon as reasonably practicable. Any decision by us
                            with regard to such a claim will be final</p>

                            You can spend your Points at any time by going to the “Rewards Center” located under the
                            “Explore” tab on the main page. Points are awarded for survey completion, personal profile
                            surveys, and other participation on this Site. Points are automatically converted to cash
                            value when you request a payment. In our current model, 3,000 points is equivalent to
                            $1.00</p>

                            payments will be delivered within 6 weeks of your request. Raaye will mail check payments
                            to the address listed within your account. Please make sure that we have your correct
                            address to avoid any delays in delivery. Additionally, checks are valid for one (1) year,
                            and members must report a missing payment within one (1) year from the request date in order
                            to for Raaye to re-issue payment.</p>

                            your Account. Be sure to keep this updated to ensure delivery. For electronic gift cards and
                            vouchers, please view the reward details in the Rewards Center for each reward for specific
                            details on standard delivery methods and timelines. All rewards are void where prohibited by

                            If you redeem your Points with paper vouchers, Raaye will send the paper voucher to the
                            mailing address you provided to us in your online registration form. Raaye will only mail
                            one paper voucher. If you do not receive the paper voucher and we reasonably determine that
                            you are entitled to a replacement, such replacement voucher will be an electronic one. A
                            member must request resending of a missing voucher within a time limit of 3 months from when
                            the voucher was processed.&nbsp;Raaye will not process any orders made after this 3 month
                            time limit. Please ensure your postal address is correct and complete in your account,
                            otherwise, in case of voucher returns the charges will be incurred to you.</p>

                            When Points are credited to your account they will remain valid for one year (12 months)
                            from the date they are earned. If after this period the Points have not been used, they will
                            automatically expire and be deleted from your account. This deduction will always occur
                            towards the end of the month, usually on the 28th day. For example, if you earned Points on
                            15 March 2016, they will be removed from your account on 28 March 2017, if they are still in
                            your account. Points cannot be redeemed after the expiration date.</p>

                            In addition, all of your Points will immediately expire and be forfeited in the event that
                            you cancel your account at Raaye or if your account becomes "inactive." To be an active
                            member means that you have joined Raaye and participated in a Survey or other activity on
                            this Site within 12 months from your initial registration or within the preceding 12 months.
                            Raaye will not provide you with any notice of the cancellation and forfeiture of any of

                            signs of fraud, abuse or suspicious activity, your member account may be terminated and you
                            may forfeit all accumulated Points. If you have conducted any fraudulent activity, Raaye

                            losses to Raaye, including litigation costs and damages, and you will not be allowed to

                            member account has been the subject of suspicious activity, please contact Raaye
                            immediately. If it is determined that you have been the victim of fraud, the Points you have

                            Any revisions may affect your ability to use any Points you accumulate. If the Program is
