                                Raaye invites thousands of members to answer surveys everyday on a wide array of subjects. The purpose of these surveys is to collect your opinions about the products and services of large consumer brands, your habits as a consumer, or about the world you live in. Your opinion will have a direct impact on companies and how they market, distribute or advertise new products and services to consumers like you.

                                We ask for personal information such as your name, address, gender, birthday and employment status to better match you with the appropriate market research projects. This information is also used for the purposes of incentive fulfillment so that we may send your reward to the appropriate recipient address. Other personal information that you may be asked to provide to us is solely for the purpose of building and operating a worldwide proprietary database of panelists, in order to conduct market research studies on that basis and we provide your responses to our surveys on to our clients in anonymised and aggregated form.

                                We do a variety of surveys for many clients. Some of these surveys are programmed by us others are programmed by our clients and hosted on their systems. A major factor in technical issues is that survey respondents are using a wide variety of operating systems, browsers, Internet connection types, and hardware, and not all are necessarily compatible with the technology of all surveys that may be available. And, of course, sometimes, human error is a factor. If you encounter a technical problem with a survey, usually, if you wait a while, then try again later, the problem will be resolved. If you are still seeing an error after waiting a while, please report it to us here and note the Survey ID. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by technical errors and will do our best to get them resolved.

                                Sometimes this happens if a survey is generating greater than expected responses. Also, the invitations aren't necessarily delivered right away by your email service provider. We apologize for any inconvenience you may experience and thank you for your participation. Please know that more survey opportunities will become available.

                                Your Profile Surveys can be accessed by clicking the "Surveys" tab at the top of the site, here you will see the "Profile Surveys" option. Profile Surveys are designed to allow us to improve personalization of the service we provide to you for completing your Profile Surveys. This means you will receive more, and better targeted, survey invitations. Profile Surveys are divided into three categories: surveys you haven't answered yet, surveys you answered but have since been updated and require your attention (New), and surveys you have already answered. For each completed personal profile survey you are awarded 100 points.

                            <div id="15" class="collapse">
                                This is because some surveys are looking for a very specific group of people who meet a very narrow set of demographic or other criteria. Sometimes, determining whether someone qualifies for a survey takes just a few questions other times, it may take more questions. Please know we appreciate your participation and that even when you don't qualify, your participation helps contribute to the success of the study.
                                To increase the chances that you will qualify for future online surveys, complete all of the member personal profile surveys. Remember, you are awarded 100 points for each personal profile survey you complete!

                                The timing of crediting for points or sweepstakes entries depends on the survey. For some surveys, credits are applied very quickly or within a few days, while for others, the credits are applied after the survey has closed. You can expect to wait a maximum of six weeks for points to be credited to your account from when a survey closes, though we try to limit this as much as possible.

                                Raaye's profiling process is continuous — the objective being to have broad and current attributes on each member. Our clients make marketing decisions based on responses from our members in their surveys so we must implement strict quality controls to make sure you are part of the target the client is looking for. The questions we ask at the beginning of each survey may seem repetitive but are necessary to ensure the integrity of the survey sample.

                                When you do not qualify for a survey, your responses cannot be used in the final research findings, and therefore are never transferred to our clients. Likewise, Raaye will never use or transfer these responses for internal use. As the information you entered cannot be used for our client’s research, most times no reward will be issued for an incomplete study.

                                Raaye will only send a limited number of surveys on mobile to specific users that we believe will qualify. You will not be required to answer the survey by text message. The SMS you will receive will include a link to the survey.
                                When you access a survey from your smartphone, please make sure you have a good internet connectivity. We recommend using a Wi-Fi secure connection, instead of taking the survey through your Mobile Internet Plan/Mobile Data, to avoid additional costs on your monthly bill/top-up.

If after this period the points have not been used, they will automatically expire and be deleted from your account. Your points will not expire all at once, instead points will expire 12 months after you originally earned them (for example: if you have earned points on the 15th of March 2013, they will be removed on the 28th of March 2014, if they are still in your account). This deduction will always occur towards the end of the month in which they were earned, near the 28th. Please don't wait until the last moment to redeem your points.

                                Yes, you can complete long surveys on the app just like you can on our website, so you can let your voice be heard and earn rewards on the go. Not to mention, while you can continue to create polls and topics you can also create a 'Thumb It' and a 'Battle' – Thumb It lets you take a photo of something you see whilst you're out and allows you to get a quick thumbs up or down vote from your fellow community members; whilst a Battle lets you post images of two different things and posts them side-by-side so you can let the community decide which they prefer. Please check out the great video we made for the iPhone App by clicking on the link here for more information.
