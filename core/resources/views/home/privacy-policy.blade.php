                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Technologies such as cookies, web beacons/web bugs, scripts, and

                            providers. These technologies are used in analysing trends, administering the site, tracking
                            users’ movements around the site and the Internet, and to gather demographic information
                            about our user base as a whole. Our clients may combine your survey responses, demographic
                            information, and web surfing behaviour with those of others to produce “aggregated” reports.
                            They may also create scientific reports based upon modelled information. “Modelled
                            information” is data developed based upon demographic and behavioural characteristics (like
                            your gender, age, and websites visited) to predict what people with similar or matching
                            characteristics would watch or buy. We may receive reports based on the use of these
                            technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.<br>We use

                            not use digital fingerprinting technology (the “<strong>Technology</strong>”) to collect

                            Technology to assist our clients in ensuring the integrity of survey results. The Technology
                            will analyse publicly available information and data obtained from your computer's web
                            browser and from other publicly available data points, including the technical settings of
                            your computer, the characteristics of your computer, and its IP Address, to create a unique
                            identifier, which will be assigned to your computer. The unique identifier will be an
                            alpha-numeric ID In order to assist our clients in protecting and ensuring the integrity of
                            survey results, we may; (a) link or associate your unique identifier to you and any of your
